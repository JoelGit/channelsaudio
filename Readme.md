Quick hack bookmarklet to grab the video stream, and open an audio stream. Because sometimes I want to listen to a show, not watch it :)

Requires you to bring up the shows modal (where you can see the Watch Now button), then hit the bookmarklet.

Note: This works with both recorded and live shows, but for live shows it requires a couple of extra steps. When you hit the bookmarklet it will open a new window/tab but the show won't play. Go back to the original window and tab the Watch Now button. It should then start playing just audio and Safari can be backgrounded.

This requires Channels DVR.
